| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MESSAGE   | STR  | Text string, max length of the string is not set, though driver developers need to keep in mind that this information shows up in Navigators in a ticker or similar scrolling text display and should not be cluttered but kept to key things like HVAC system errors, and CRITICAL information. |

 

### Returns

`None`


### Usage Note

This string may or may not have multiple message segments. If it does, the message segments are delimited by a \n (newlines). Some protocol drivers such as the c4-therm support up to 4 lines of messages. Most UI's scroll these \n delimited messages right to left in a marquee style.
