## THERMOSTAT EVENTS

The Thermostat Proxy fires the following events. If any of the registered variables change value, an event is fired; however those events are generated by the Variable Manager, and the proxy doesn't concern itself with those. Like most old proxies, events could be eliminated by just having programming use the registered variables.

In the past some UI's listened for variables not DataToUI calls.Â In 2.7.0 all UI's no longer listen to variable changed events, but it's worth noting that old UI's did.
